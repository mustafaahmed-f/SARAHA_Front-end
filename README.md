      <h2># About</h2>
      <p>
        This is the front end of SARAHA project ( It is a full stack project ) created using react.js library ( Vite is used as a bundler ).
      </p>
      <p>
        It provides a user authentication system, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. The application features a messaging system where users can send and receive messages. It also includes a responsive and intuitive user interface, as well as pagination for displaying messages.
      </p>
      <p>
         The project utilizes React Router DOM for routing, React's code splitting for optimizing loading time, and Redux Toolkit for state management. The codebase is organized into components, actions, reducers, and services, following best practices for scalable and maintainable code. The project is open source and available on GitHub, where you can explore the code, contribute, and provide feedback.
